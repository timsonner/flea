# Flea backend protocol

One JSON object per line, newline-delimited, over the `flea --backend` child's stdin
and stdout. No batching, no length prefix: `Quickshell.Io.Process` reads with a
`SplitParser` on `\n`. Implemented in `src/backend/proto.rs` over the field scanner and
escaper in `src/json.rs`, dispatched by `src/backend/run.rs`.

## Invariants

1. A successful `list` is always followed by a `rows` line, even when `first` is
   0, in which case the array is empty. A `list` whose path cannot be read
   answers a single `error` line instead, and no `rows` line follows.
2. Errors are messages, never exit statuses. `--backend` runs until it reads `quit`
   or stdin closes, and returns exit code 0 either way; every failure is an `error`
   line the client reads off stdout, not a process exit code.
3. Exactly one line arrives unasked: `changed`, which says the listed directory was
   altered by another program. It can land between any request and its reply, so a
   client that counts lines rather than reading their `t` field will misread the wire.
4. A row index means a file only in the numbering it was read from. Every `rows` line
   names that numbering as `listing`, and a `trash`, `transfer`, `paths`, `collisions` or `menuaction`
   that names an older one is refused before anything resolves; see "listing" below.

## Requests

### listing

`"listing":<uint>` on a request that carries `rows`

Example: `{"c":"trash","rows":[0],"menuId":0,"listing":7}`

The backend numbers its rows, and the number moves whenever what an index names changes: a
successful `list` or `listpaths`, a `search`, an accepted `sort`, and a walk's ranking. Every `rows`
line carries the numbering it was written in as its last field, `"listing":<uint>`, and the first
listing a backend makes is 1. A client names the numbering of the rows it read an index from on any
request that carries `rows`. A `trash`, `transfer`, `paths`, `collisions` or `menuaction` whose `listing` is not
the numbering in force is refused before a single index is resolved: `trash`, `transfer`, `paths`
and `collisions` answer `{"t":"error","where":"stale","path":"<the command>","msg":"..."}` and nothing else, and a
`menuaction` answers its own reply with `"ok":false` and an `error` sentence. Nothing was done in
either case, so a client that wants the action reads the new rows and asks again.

A request that names no `listing` is resolved against the listing in force, exactly as before the
field existed, so an older client and a hand-written line keep working. `thumb`, `thumbcancel`,
`dirsize`, `meta` and `window` read and never act on a file, so they are not refused; a client drops
their answers for a listing it has left. The race this closes is a request written after a `list`
and before its `rows` reached the client: the backend has the new listing by then, and without the
field it resolved the old index against it, so `list A`, `list B`, `paths [0]` answered B's first file.

### list

`{"c":"list","path":"<string>","first":<uint>,"hidden":<bool>}`

Example: `{"c":"list","path":"/home/gm","first":350,"hidden":false}`

Scans `path` (phase 1: names and the directory bit only), applies ordering, and
answers a `listed` line followed immediately by a `rows` line
covering rows `0..first`. A `path` that fails to scan answers a single `error` line
instead and leaves the previously listed directory in place: a failed `list` cannot
mix a new `path` with the old listing. A missing `path` defaults to the empty string,
a missing `first` defaults to `0`.

Optional `by`, `desc`, `foldersFirst`, and `groupByKind` fields use the ordering
rules described under `sort`. A list with no ordering fields uses name ascending,
directories first, without kind groups. Unlike an explicit `sort`, a `list` may
omit `by`. An invalid ordering key refuses the new listing and keeps the previous
directory and rows.

`hidden` of `false`, or a missing `hidden`, drops every name starting with `.` before
it ever reaches the listing: the filter runs inside the scan itself, not as a later
pass over it, so a hidden directory costs nothing beyond the `readdir` entry it was
always going to read. `hidden` of `true` scans dotfiles in too, ordered the same as
everything else. There is no separate flag to ask for dotfiles without also
re-scanning: `sort` reorders whichever listing `list` last produced and cannot add or
remove rows, so changing `hidden` always means a fresh `list`, which is also what
clears the cursor and selection back to row 0.

### locate

`{"c":"locate","path":"/directory/selected.txt"}`

Returns `{"t":"located","directory":"/directory","path":"/directory/selected.txt","index":42}`
for a name already in the current listing, or `index:-1` when absent or invalid. This reads only
the listing's name arena; it does not stat files, resolve symlinks or scan another directory.
The client must match both `directory` and the requested `path` before using the index, then
fetch only the viewport containing that row. This is location in the current listing, not proof
that the filesystem object still exists or has the same identity for a later operation.

`{"c":"locate","paths":["/directory/selected.txt"],"id":7,"menuId":4}` resolves a batch
in one scan of the name arena. The reply carries `directory`, the request `id`, `ok`, `error`,
and `matches:[{"path":"/directory/selected.txt","index":42}]`. Missing paths are omitted,
duplicates produce one match, and results follow listing order. No unrequested path is returned.
Without `menuId`, this has the same name-only semantics as the single-path form. With `menuId`,
each matched survivor must still have the device, inode and file type captured by that completed
permanent deletion. This explicitly requested survivor check stats only matched paths.
The backend retains one completed deletion's identities for this read-only purpose even after
`menuaction/close` has expired the mutable selection. An expired restoration identity returns
`ok:false` and no matches. Clients must also reject replies after navigation, selection changes,
or replacement of the pending request, and fetch metadata only for the visible window.

### menuaction identity and deletion

`{"c":"menuaction","op":"activate","id":4,"action":"duplicate"}` revalidates the
selection captured by `snapshot` before the GUI dispatches a selected-item menu action.
The response echoes `id`, `op`, and `action`, with `ok` and `error`. Only clipboard, Copy Path,
and compression actions return captured `paths`; other actions do not serialize unused paths.
The client also rechecks its listing identity and current action eligibility before dispatch.

An optional `menuId` on `transfer`, `trash`, `duplicate`, `rename`, `archive`, or `convert`
binds that operation to the captured selection. An expired selection, replacement object,
or uncaptured requested source is refused. Transfer uses the captured sources directly;
Trash, Duplicate, Archive, and Convert require the entire requested source set to match.
Identity checks compare the device, inode and file type at the worker boundary; Trash checks again immediately before its existing GIO
batch handoff. These checks do not make subsequent external-helper filesystem operations
atomic. Omitting `menuId` preserves the existing keyboard and protocol entry paths.

`{"c":"menuaction","op":"snapshot","id":4,"rows":[0,2]}` captures the selected identities
from the active listing. `prepareDelete` with that `id` reviews the captured trees and returns a
fresh `token`, selected `count`, and total `bytes`. `checkDelete` with the `id` and `token` returns
`valid` without mutating files. A changed set requires `refreshDelete`: it reviews only the same
captured paths, drops missing paths, captures replacement identities, and issues a fresh token.
Unrelated paths cannot widen that confirmation. The client shows this new confirmation with
Cancel initially focused; no prior destructive activation authorizes the replacement token.

`{"c":"menuaction","op":"delete","id":4,"token":12}` consumes that exact token and reserves
the ordinary mutation slot. A failed preflight returns `stale:true` and requires a fresh review;
it does not delete any item. A completed attempt returns `deleted`, `failed`, `cancelled`,
`error`, and `remaining` absolute paths whose original identities survive. Results report partial
completion rather than implying rollback. The caller can use the identity-checked batched
`locate` form to select survivors after refreshing the listing.
`close` expires the token and cancels pending work. An already claimed deletion root completes
or restores its survivors before cancellation stops the next root. The undo journal does not
cover permanent deletion.

### listpaths

`{"c":"listpaths","paths":[<string>,...],"first":<uint>}`

Example: `{"c":"listpaths","paths":["/home/gm/Pictures/a.png","/home/gm/Downloads"],"first":80}`

Builds a fresh listing out of the paths the client names, replacing the current one, and answers a
`listed` line followed immediately by a `rows` line covering rows `0..first`, exactly as `list`
does. The listing's base is `/` and each entry is its absolute path with the leading slash removed,
so `window`, `thumb`, `paths` and every other per-row facility keep working with no special case
anywhere; that is the same shape a `search` listing takes, for the same reason. The client splits
the last `/` itself when it wants to draw a name rather than a path.

**Nothing is sorted.** The order the client sent is the order it gets back, because the one caller
is the picker's Recent location and its order is the history's own, newest first; a sort by name
would throw that away. `read` on the `listed` line is the time this build took and `sort` is always
`0.0`.

**A path that does not exist is dropped, not listed.** The build `lstat`s each one, so a history
entry whose file has since been deleted never reaches the client, rather than arriving as a row
whose `p`, `s` and `m` are all 0. A path that is not absolute, and the root itself, are dropped the
same way: this list is read out of a file every application on the desktop writes, so it is checked
here rather than trusted. The type recorded in `d` is the link's own, the same rule `list` follows,
so a symlink to a directory is listed as a file and a symlink to nothing is still an entry.

There is no cancel and no streaming: the build is one `lstat` per path inside the read loop, and the
one caller sends a few hundred at most.

### window

`{"c":"window","start":<uint>,"count":<uint>}`

Example: `{"c":"window","start":1200,"count":350}`

Stats rows `start..start+count` of the current listing (phase 2) and answers one
`rows` line. `start` and `count` are clamped to the listing's length, so a stale or
out-of-range window never panics, it just returns fewer rows or none. Missing fields
default to `0`.

### sort

`{"c":"sort","by":"<string>","desc":<bool>,"foldersFirst":<bool>,"groupByKind":<bool>}`

Example: `{"c":"sort","by":"size","desc":true}`
Re-sorts the current listing by `by` and answers a `listed` line. The four orders are:

- `"name"` works on phase-1 data alone: `read` is `0.0` and `sort` is the sort.
- `"size"` and `"mtime"` pay the metadata pass first, one `lstat` per row of the whole
  listing split across the cores, then sort. A size sort also walks every folder's subtree
  under one shared 250 ms budget for the whole sort, and that walk is part of the pass,
  so its time lands in `read` too. `read` is that pass in milliseconds and `sort`
  is the sort, so the two costs stay readable apart on the wire.
- `"kind"` compares MIME type strings obtained from filenames, with
  `application/octet-stream` for an unknown name and `inode/directory` for a folder.
  It does not read file contents or run a metadata pass; `read` is `0.0`.

`foldersFirst` defaults to `true`: folders remain before files in both directions.
With `foldersFirst:false`, the key orders folders and files together. `groupByKind`
defaults to `false`; when true it takes precedence over `foldersFirst` and fixes
three groups in this order: folders, images (MIME type starts with `image/`), then
all remaining files. Groups do not reverse with `desc`. Kind grouping uses filename
MIME lookup, not content probing.

Inside each group, or across the whole listing when ungrouped, the key decides and
the name order breaks ties, so two equal sizes list the same way every run, and
`desc` is the exact reverse of ascending inside the group,
tie-break included. A size order walks each folder's subtree and orders folders by that
recursive size, the same number the `dirsized` line reports, so the order agrees with the
size column the way it already did for files; an mtime order lists them by time like
everything else. A folder that hit the shared budget orders by the floor it counted.
A size sort seeds the answered-row cache only with the folders it finished walking, so a
later `dirsize` for one of them is answered from the cache rather than walked twice. A folder
the budget cut off seeds nothing, and is walked again by the worker at its own per-row
deadline when the client asks, because a floor must not stand in for a size.

**A size order is best effort on a directory large enough to exhaust the 250 ms budget.** A
folder cut off by it is placed on the floor that was counted, and that floor is used for the
order alone: it is never sent, so nothing on the wire says the order was built from one. The
size the column shows for that folder arrives later, from a separate walk at the two second
per-row deadline, and the two walks carry no ordering relation to each other, so that number
can be larger or smaller than the floor the row was placed on. Its `dirsized` line carries
`partial` true only when that second walk ran out as well. On such a directory the column can
therefore disagree with the order it was sorted into, and a re-sort can still place two
folders by their floors. A client holding both the order and the later sizes can see that
disagreement; what it cannot tell from the wire is whether a floor or a changed tree caused
it. The budget is what keeps the whole pass short while it runs on the event loop, and this is the cost of that
choice.
The stat
is the same `lstat` that `rows` reports `s` and `m` from, so the order always agrees with the
column, symlinks included, and a row that vanished between the listing and the pass sorts as
the zeroes `rows` would send for it.

**Sort metadata is not retained between requests.** Reversing a size order stats the directory again and walks the folders again, bounded by the same budget each time,
because a listing in name order must not carry metadata it is not using. The stats
live for one request. Historical measurements from 2026-09-02, using the default
name ordering and directory grouping: on the 100,000 file fixture the backend's PSS
read 4781 kB after the listing and
4945 kB after a size sort (one `smaps_rollup` reading each), with a transient peak 3.2 MB
above that while the pass ran. Measured on that fixture, warm, on 2026-09-02, from the
`read` and `sort` fields of the `listed` line: the pass took 25 to 38 ms on twelve cores and
125 to 135 ms pinned to one with `taskset -c 0`, and the sort behind it 6 to 7 ms against
5 ms for name; on a three-row directory the whole request stayed under half a millisecond.
Cold is IO-bound, and the KB measured the same pass at about 1 s serial and 0.3 s on twelve
threads. The pass runs inside the loop, so a size or date sort of a very large directory on
a slow mount stalls other backend requests for its duration. An initial `list`
explicitly requesting one of those orders pays that same metadata pass.

**An unsupported, empty, missing, or non-string `by` answers an `error` line**,
never a `listed` line in name order. The error names the supplied string key, or an
empty key when no string was supplied. This prevents a refused request from silently
resetting the existing order. A refused `sort` leaves the listing in its existing
order. `sort` never emits a `rows` line on its own;
follow it with `window` to see the reordered rows. A missing `desc` defaults to `false`.

An optional `anchor` names the cursor's logical row for this re-sort as an absolute path,
`{"c":"sort","by":"size","anchor":"/home/gm/amber"}`, and the `listed` line answers it with
`"anchor"` echoing that path and `"anchorIndex"` carrying its index in the new order, or `-1`
when that path is not in the listing. Each reply answers only its own request's anchor, so a
burst of re-sorts needs no shared generation count: the client moves the cursor only when the
reply's anchor is still the newest one it sent, and ignores a superseded or foreign one. A
request without `anchor` answers exactly the `listed` line it always has, so every older client
keeps parsing what it knows.

`mtime` names the same stat field that `rows` carries as `m`; the GUI labels it
"Modified". `date` is also accepted as an alias for `mtime`, matching the saved
Settings value. `mode` is not a supported sort key.

### search

`{"c":"search","path":"<string>","query":"<string>","hidden":<bool>}`

Example: `{"c":"search","path":"/home/gm","query":"dwnhelp","hidden":false}`

Walks the whole subtree under `path` and streams every entry whose path relative to `path`
contains `query` as a case-insensitive subsequence, into a fresh listing that replaces the
current one. The match is fuzzy rather than a substring, and it runs over the whole relative
path rather than the base name, so `dwnhelp` finds `downloads/helper.txt`. `hidden` follows
`list`'s rule exactly: `false`, or missing, drops dot-prefixed names before they are
counted or descended, so a `.git` costs one `readdir` entry and nothing more.

`path` is whatever the client asks for, and the backend walks exactly that and nothing else:
a client searching a whole home directory sends home as the `path`, and one searching a mount
sends the mount. The backend has no notion of home and no scope of its own.

**Results are ranked, and the rank is what makes a subsequence match usable.** A subsequence
over a hundred thousand entries matches far too much to read, so every match carries a score
and the walk answers in score order. Characters matching consecutively score highest; a
character starting the candidate, a path segment, a word or a camelCase hump scores next; a
character in the file's own name beats one in a parent directory the query merely passed
through; and every candidate character skipped between two matches is charged back. Ties go
to the shorter path, then to the listing's own name order, so one walk over one tree always
answers in exactly one order.

**A search result is a listing like any other, and that is what makes it cheap.** Each match
is pushed as its path relative to `path`, and `path` becomes the listing's base, so
`window`, `thumb`, `dirsize` and every other per-row facility keep working with no special
case anywhere. The client splits the last `/` itself to draw the name and its location
column; the backend never sends a second shape.

Matches are appended in discovery order and never re-sorted mid-walk, so a `window` the
client already holds stays valid as the count grows. The order changes exactly once, at the
end: `searched` is written after the rows have been ranked, so a client re-reads its window
when it sees that line and every row index it held before then is stale. That is the same
rule a `sort` follows, for the same reason. The walk is answered in three parts:

1. One `listed` with `n` of 0, immediately, because the client's old rows are gone the
   moment the request is read.
2. A `searching` line carrying the growing count and the entries scanned so far, at most one
   every 100 ms while the walk runs.
3. One terminal `searched` line, written after the ranking.

There is no trailing `listed` or `searching`: `searched` carries the final count itself, so a walk that a
new listing replaced never announces a total it no longer has.

The walk runs in bounded slices inside the same single-threaded loop everything else uses,
four directories per slice, so a `searchcancel` or any other request is never queued behind
a subtree. A symlink reports its own type, so a link to a directory is listed but never
descended and no loop is possible. An unreadable directory is skipped in silence, the same
way `scan` skips an unreadable entry. A `path` that cannot be read at all is not an error:
the walk finishes at once with `n` and `scanned` both 0.

`list` and `sort` both end a running walk before they touch the listing, and answer their
own lines after the walk's terminal `searched`.

### searchcancel

`{"c":"searchcancel"}`

Stops the running walk and answers one `searched` line with `cancelled` true. Whatever the
walk already found stays in the listing, is ranked the same way a walk that ran to the end is,
and stays windowable. Unlike `thumbcancel` there is
no `rows` form: one walk runs at a time, so a cancel can only mean that one. A
`searchcancel` with no walk running does nothing and answers nothing.

### thumb

`{"c":"thumb","rows":[<uint>,...]}`

Example: `{"c":"thumb","rows":[2,17,140]}`

Asks for a thumbnail for those row indices of the current listing, and answers one
`thumbed` line per row. **This is the only thing that ever generates a thumbnail.** The
backend never walks a directory looking for work: a row that no client named is never
looked at, at any priority.

An off storage class still asks, and the backend answers from the cache alone. A client
on a network, phone or USB directory whose switch is off sends
`{"c":"thumb","rows":[<uint>,...>],"cacheOnly":true}`, and a genuine cache miss then
answers an empty `file` at once rather than queueing a decode: one stat of the source
per visible row and no read, so a NAS folder costs a metadata round trip instead of
about 48 MB. A row already in the shared cache answers with that entry's path, whether
or not the source can still be opened, and thumbnails another application already made
still show. Absent `cacheOnly` is today's full path, so a local folder and an older
client are unchanged.

Each index is clamped to the listing: a row past the end is skipped in silence, because
there is no row to answer for. A missing or malformed `rows` is an empty array and the
request does nothing. Indices may repeat and need not be sorted; the newest request for a
row replaces the older one.

Four of the answers cost no work at all and come back on the same line the request
arrived on. A directory row, a row that is not a regular file, and a row whose MIME type no
validated thumbnailer declares all answer immediately with an empty `file`; that is the same
condition the `t` flag in a `rows` object reports, so a client that honours `t` never asks.
A row already in the shared cache at the file's current mtime answers immediately with that
entry's path, and a row recorded as failed at that mtime answers immediately with an empty
`file`. Only a genuine cache miss is queued, and its `thumbed` line arrives later.

The queue is bounded, and a request larger than it is still answered in full. When the queue
is full the oldest job in it is dropped to make room, and the row that job belonged to is
answered at once with an empty `file` rather than left waiting.

**What the shipped client sends.** `ui/Pane.qml` sends `thumb` only when the list settles,
which is a 120 ms timer restarted by every scroll and by every arriving window of rows, so a
fling issues nothing at all until it stops. One request names only rows currently visible,
only rows whose `rows` object carried `t:true`, and only rows the client's own map does not
already hold.

**That map has four states and only two of them are terminal.** Absent means unknown, `null`
means asked and waiting, a non-empty string is the answer's path, and an empty string is a
real answer meaning this row has no thumbnail. The two string states are terminal: every
answer is recorded, an empty `file` included, and an answered row is never asked about again
while this listing stands. The other two are not. Rows that left the viewport while still
waiting are named in a `thumbcancel` sent immediately before the same settle's `thumb`, and a
cancelled row drops back to absent rather than to a terminal state, because the backend
forgets the job it drops and would otherwise never answer it. **A row that scrolls out while
waiting and scrolls back is therefore asked for a second time, and that is correct.** A client
that treats "asked once" as terminal leaves a permanently empty slot on every such row.
`ui/js/Thumbs.js` is the shipped implementation, its `forget` is the drop back to absent, and
`tests/js/thumbs.js` holds it under the name "a cancelled row can be asked for again".

Neither request is ever sent with an empty `rows`, because that form cancels everything.
Opening a directory clears the client's whole map, since an index names a different file
afterwards. See AGENTS.md "Thumbnail requests in the GUI".

### thumbcancel

`{"c":"thumbcancel","rows":[<uint>,...]}`

Example: `{"c":"thumbcancel","rows":[17,140]}`

Drops queued jobs for those rows. An empty or missing `rows` cancels everything queued.
A job that a worker has already started cannot be cancelled and still answers with a
`thumbed` line; only work still in the queue is dropped. A cancelled row is not answered,
so a client that cancels must stop waiting for it. No response line.

A cancelled row can be asked for again straight away, in either form of the request: cancelling
forgets the row as well as its job, so a later `thumb` for it queues fresh work rather than
being deduplicated against the job that was just dropped.

### fsinfo

`{"c":"fsinfo"}`

Answers one `fsinfo` line for the directory the current listing came from:
`{"t":"fsinfo","fs":"<string>","free":<uint>,"path":"<string>","class":"<string>"}`.
`fs` is the filesystem's own name and `free` its bytes available to an unprivileged
process; `path` is the directory they are of, so a client that has since moved can
tell they describe somewhere else. `class` is that directory's storage class,
`network`, `phone`, `usb` or `""` for local, computed once per directory change
beside this line and never per row: network is cifs, smb3, nfs, sshfs, rclone, 9p,
ceph and any gvfs FUSE share, phone is gvfs mtp, gphoto2 and afc, and usb is a block
device whose sysfs path runs through USB or whose removable flag is 1. An unreadable
path answers an empty `fs` with a free of 0 rather than a wrong number.
On a slow mount, a gvfs share or a kernel network filesystem, the statfs behind the
figures is a network round trip, so it runs on a worker thread, one per mount at a time, the
newest folder asked for going next: a share starts it once its `list` rows are sent, for a client that has asked `fsinfo`
before, and a kernel mount when `fsinfo` does. The statfs reads the listed folder itself,
because an sftp host or a phone's storages answer differently below one mount. `fsinfo`
answers at once with the class and that folder's last known figures, or unknown figures
(`"fs":""`, `"free":0`) on a first visit. When the worker returns, a second `fsinfo` line for
the same `path` carries the fresh figures, sent only when they differ from what that folder
last answered and only while it is still the listed directory. A client must accept that line
at any time: it updates the figures in place and changes nothing else.
Local and USB directories answer figures and class in the one line, exactly as before.

### dirsize

`{"c":"dirsize","rows":[<uint>,...]}`

Example: `{"c":"dirsize","rows":[4,9]}`

Asks for the recursive apparent size of those row indices, and answers one `dirsized` line
per row that names a directory. **This is the only thing that ever walks a directory looking
for size**, the same rule `thumb` follows for thumbnails: a row no client named is never
walked. A row that is not a directory, or past the end of the listing, is skipped in silence.

One persistent background worker walks one directory at a time. The event loop remains
available for navigation while a walk runs. A list, sort or `dirsizecancel` invalidates
unfinished size work using a generation counter. Cancelled or stale replies cannot populate
the current listing's cache. Cancellation and the 2000 ms deadline are checked between
filesystem calls; a blocked filesystem call may delay further sizes but never holds up the
navigation event loop. No replacement worker is spawned while the old one is still busy.
A row already answered for the current listing answers again from its cache; a row already
queued or running costs nothing extra.

**What the shipped client sends.** `ui/List.qml` sends `dirsize` only when the list settles, the
same 120&nbsp;ms timer `thumb` already waits on, so a fling issues nothing at all. One request
names only the directory rows currently visible and not already known.

### dirsizecancel

`{"c":"dirsizecancel"}`

Drops every directory row still queued and cancels the running walk cooperatively. Unlike `thumbcancel`, there is no rows
form: the walker is one at a time, so a stale row left over from a scrolled-past viewport would
delay the row the new viewport actually wants, and the client always means "everything" when it
sends this. A row already answered is untouched; queued and unfinished work is discarded. No response line.

A directory a `dirsizecancel` dropped can be asked for again straight away: cancelling forgets
the row, so a later `dirsize` for it queues fresh work.

### transfer

`{"c":"transfer","op":"<string>","paths":["<string>",...],"dest":"<string>"}`

Example: `{"c":"transfer","op":"copy","paths":["/home/gm/a.txt","/home/gm/photos"],"dest":"/home/gm/backup"}`

Copies or moves each top-level path into `dest`. `op` of `"move"` moves; **anything else, including a
missing `op`, copies**, so a malformed request can never remove a source. `paths` are absolute; `dest`
is an absolute directory that must already exist, because Flea does not create a destination as a side
effect of a transfer. A `dest` that is missing, relative, or not a directory answers a single `error`
line with `where` of `transfer` and nothing is started.

Unlike `thumb` and `dirsize`, this names paths rather than row indices: a transfer outlives the listing
it was started from, and a row index would name a different file by the time it ran.

**A `rows` array of indices into the current listing may be sent instead of `paths`**, because a client
can only build a path for a row inside the window it holds, and a selection can be wider than that. The
indices are resolved against the listing at request time and the operation runs on the resulting paths,
so it still owns a snapshot that outlives whatever the listing does next. `paths` wins when both are
present, and an index past the end of the listing is dropped in silence.

**One of `transfer`, `trash`, `duplicate` or an archive `extract` runs at a time.** One of those
arriving while another is still running answers an `error` line saying so and touches nothing. The cap
is one because the status bar carries one transient slot for the running operation, and an extract
drives that same card, so a second concurrent operation would have nowhere to report. `rename` and
`mkdir` never take that slot, and an archive `compress` and a `convert` are keyed by their own `id` and
run alongside by design, so the cap was never one write of any kind.

The answer is a `transferstarted` line for a file transfer, then per top-level item a bounded stream of
`transferprogress` lines and exactly one `transferitem`, then one `transferdone`. An archive `extract`
uses `extractstarted` for its activity card and `archivedone` for its terminal line.

**Semantics that are decided here rather than left to the caller.** A same-filesystem move is a
`rename(2)`; a cross-filesystem move is a copy followed by removing the source, and the source is only
removed once the copy is complete, so a process killed mid-move leaves the source intact and a partial
file at the destination, never the reverse. A symlink is copied as a symlink and never followed. A
fifo or a socket is recreated at the destination with the source's own mode rather than opened,
because neither holds contents to stream and an open of one would wait for a writer or fail. A device
node takes the same path, but creating one needs `CAP_MKNOD`, so an unprivileged copy fails that item
with `EPERM` instead of recreating it; either way nothing streams from a device that never ends. A
destination that already exists is refused for that item rather than overwritten, because every write
here creates its target exclusively, unless the request carries a choice for it, below; even `replace`
never overwrites, it moves the item already there to the trash and then still creates exclusively.
Directory recursion is invisible on this wire: the backend walks a
tree to copy it and the client sees only the top-level item's lines, so the wire's shape does not depend
on how deep a folder is.

**Copies onto removable, phone and network targets are durable before "done".** When the
destination classes usb, phone or network, or its filesystem is vfat, exfat or ntfs, each file is
fsync'd after its last write and every directory Flea created or wrote into is fsync'd before the
transfer reports done. An rclone mount is the exception: the copy lands in rclone's cache first,
so no fsync forces its upload and the done line names the background upload instead. Local btrfs and ext4 targets keep today's behaviour. A failed file fsync fails
that item like any other copy error and journals the partial for undo. The same rule covers a
same-directory duplicate, a redo of a copy, and a same-filesystem rename onto a durable target:
the new files are fsync'd, and the destination directory (and the source directory for a move)
with them; a rename that already landed reports success either way, because claiming otherwise
would lie about what happened.

**A choice for names that already exist rides on two optional fields**, `collide` and `collideId`:

Example: `{"c":"transfer","op":"copy","paths":["/home/gm/Desktop/screenshot.png"],"dest":"/home/gm/Pictures","collide":"replace","collideId":7}`

`collide` is `"keep"`, `"replace"`, `"skip"` or `"refuse"`, and `collideId` is the `id` of the
`collisions` question it answers. A missing `collide` is the transfer exactly as it was before this
field existed, so an older client is unchanged; any word but those four refuses, so a malformed choice
can never replace. **The choice covers only what the question listed**: an item whose source that
question named for this same `dest`, whose name there still holds the same item it held then (device,
inode and file type). A name that appears after the question, or whose item was swapped since, is
refused exactly as before whatever the choice, and so is every name when `collideId` names no
question, another destination, or a question an earlier transfer already spent.

`keep` lands the incoming item under the name `duplicate` would give it, worked out in `dest`:
`photo copy.png`, then `photo copy 2.png`. `skip` leaves the item where it is and counts it in
`transferdone`'s `skipped`, with no `transferitem` line. `replace` moves the item already there to the
freedesktop trash first, through the same `gio` call and URI capture `trash` uses, and then transfers
the incoming one under the name; a folder is replaced whole and never merged into. A trash that refuses
fails that item with `the item already there could not be moved to Trash, so nothing was replaced` and
touches nothing. An item already there that holds any source this transfer names, the item's own or
another's, fails with `the item already there holds the one being moved in, so it was not replaced`,
because trashing it would take that source along; and an incoming symlink that resolves to the item
already there now, or whose own text leads back to that name once the link sits there (looked up the way
the kernel would, through any other link on the way), fails with `the incoming link points at the item
already there, so it was not replaced`, because the copy would be a link to itself. A lookup that passes
40 links without reaching that name is let through like a dangling link: the kernel refuses it either
way, and the item it replaces waits in Trash for `undo`. A replace whose
transfer then fails, a cancel included, puts the trashed item straight back when nothing took its name,
and otherwise leaves it for `undo`. When that put-back itself fails, the item's `err` gains `; the item
it replaced is still in Trash` and the reason, and the trash step stays in the journal so `undo` can
still restore it. A cancel gains it too, as `cancelled; the item it replaced is still in Trash (<reason>)`,
and that item is counted in `failed`, not `skipped`, because its name no longer holds what it held;
`transferdone` still says `cancelled`. The trash and the transfer are one journal entry, see `undo`.

**Any `collide` word also settles an item that already lives in `dest`.** A copy lands under
`duplicate`'s name, and a move is left where it is and counted in `skipped`, with no error. Without
`collide` both still fail with `already in that folder`.

### collisions

`{"c":"collisions","id":<uint>,"paths":["<string>",...],"dest":"<string>"}`

Example: `{"c":"collisions","id":7,"paths":["/home/gm/Desktop/screenshot.png","/home/gm/Desktop/notes"],"dest":"/home/gm/Pictures"}`

Asks, before a `transfer` is sent, which of the items it would name already have their name taken in
`dest`, and answers one `collisions` line carrying the same `id`, unless a later `collisions` is sent
before it is done, below. `rows` may be sent instead of
`paths` and is resolved against the listing exactly as `transfer` resolves it, and a `menuId` asks
about that menu's captured selection instead, the one a `transfer` with that `menuId` runs on.

Example: `{"c":"collisions","id":8,"menuId":31,"dest":"/home/gm/Pictures"}`

It is read-only and never walks a tree: one `lstat` per source, one per destination name and a resolve
of each source's folder. That still measured 0.9 s for 100,000 local sources, and a network mount pays a
round trip for each, so the question runs on a thread of its own and the loop keeps answering other
requests; the `collisions` line arrives whenever it is done, and a client waits for it before sending
the `transfer`. A source that is not absolute, that no longer exists, or that already lives in `dest`
is not counted, because the transfer settles those without a question. A `dest` that is missing,
relative or not a directory answers a `total` of 0, and the `transfer` that follows answers its own
`error`.

**The backend keeps the latest question**: each colliding source with the identity of the item its
name holds in `dest`, which is what lets a `transfer` naming this `id` in `collideId` apply one choice
to exactly those names. It is kept before its `collisions` line is written, so a transfer sent after
that line always finds it. The latest question asked is the one kept and the only one answered: an
earlier question still being asked when a later one arrives is dropped without a line, the way a result
for a superseded listing is, so it is never answered after the later one's; a client asks one question
at a time and waits for its line. The next file transfer spends the kept question whether or not it names it. **A `menuId` question also keeps the menu's selection and destination as it saw them**,
and a `transfer` carrying that `menuId` and naming this question in `collideId` runs on that capture:
Copy to closes its dialog, which sends `menuaction` `close` and expires the live selection, before the
answer comes back. The capture holds the same device, inode and type identities the live selection
does, and they are still checked per item when the transfer runs. A `menuId` whose selection has
already expired answers a `total` of 0, and the `transfer` then answers `Menu selection expired`.

### transfercancel

`{"c":"transfercancel","id":<uint>}`

Example: `{"c":"transfercancel","id":12}`

Cancels the running transfer or archive `extract` if `id` names it, and does nothing otherwise, so a
cancel aimed at an operation that already finished can never reach the one after it. There is no
response line of its own: a transfer answers with its own `transferdone` carrying `cancelled` true, and
an extract answers its own `archivedone` with `ok` false and an `err` of `cancelled`.

**The item in flight is stopped rather than allowed to finish, and what it had already written is
removed: a partial file by `copy_file`, a partly-copied directory by `copy_dir`.** A cancel that waited out a multi-gigabyte copy would not be a cancel, and a half-written file
at the destination is not a result anyone asked for. That item is reported `ok:false` with an `err` of
`cancelled`; every item not yet started is counted in `skipped`. A cancelled extract stops and reaps
its sandboxed child, removes its staging directory and publishes no destination, so the same rule holds
there without a partial tree.

A `quit`, or stdin closing, cancels a running operation the same way and waits for its terminal line
before the process exits, so shutting down mid-copy also leaves nothing half-written behind.

### trash

`{"c":"trash","paths":["<string>",...],"rows":[<uint>,...]}`

Example: `{"c":"trash","paths":["/home/gm/old.txt"]}`
Example: `{"c":"trash","rows":[4,9]}`

`rows` is the same alternative to `paths` that `transfer` documents above, resolved the same way.

Moves each path to the freedesktop trash by running `gio trash`, and answers one `trashed` line.
**Nothing about the freedesktop trash specification is implemented in this codebase**, only an argv and
a result: `gio` already handles the same-filesystem-move-versus-copy question, the `.trashinfo`
metadata, and the per-mount `.Trash-$uid` fallback for a volume with no home-relative trash.

Which paths actually went is read off the filesystem afterwards rather than from `gio`'s exit status,
which covers the whole batch and cannot attribute a failure to one path.

**The trash URI of each item is captured at trash time, and this is a measured requirement rather than a
preference.** `gio trash --restore` refuses an original path outright (`Location given doesn't start
with trash:///`), and two files trashed from the same path both list that same original, so recovering
the URI later is ambiguous. The backend therefore reads `gio trash --list` immediately before and after
the call and keeps the entries that are new, which is what makes the operation reversible.

There is no confirmation step anywhere in this request, because the undo journal is the safety.

### rename

`{"c":"rename","path":"<string>","to":"<string>"}`

Example: `{"c":"rename","path":"/home/gm/old.txt","to":"new.txt"}`

Renames one file within its own directory and answers one `renamed` line. `to` is a bare name, not a
path: an empty `to`, `.`, `..`, or anything containing `/` or an interior NUL is refused with an `error`
line before any syscall runs, because a separator would move the file out of its own directory.

**The rename refuses to overwrite.** It runs `renameat2` with `RENAME_NOREPLACE` rather than
`rename(2)`, which on Unix silently replaces the target; for a file manager that is unrecoverable data
loss, and the check-then-rename alternative leaves a window in which another process can create the
target. Renaming a file to the name it already has is not an error and is not work: it answers `ok` and
records nothing to undo.

**A rename that cannot prove the source survived whole answers `rename-kept`.** Measured mounts that cannot serve
`RENAME_NOREPLACE` include `fuse.rclone` directories and `fuse.megafs` paths, which answer `EINVAL`, and a path under a
`/run/user/*/gvfs/dav:` WebDAV mount answers `EIO`. On those, the backend builds the new name through the same exclusive copy primitives every
other write uses and removes the source only once that copy is complete. The copy is taken back only on proof the source
survived whole: a source that still stats as anything but a directory after the failed removal, since
`remove_file` removes every other kind with one unlink that either takes effect or does not. That answers a plain `rename`
error, and so does a failure to take the copy back, in which case the copy stays under the new name
and that error's `path` is the copy rather than the source. Every other state keeps the copy, a directory source because `remove_dir_all`
stops at its first failure, and a source that no longer stats because an errno alone cannot tell a
removal that took effect from one that did not. The request then answers an `error` line whose
`where` is `rename-kept`, whose `path` is
the source, and whose `msg` is the removal's own message; the target is on neither field. Neither
direction journals the kept copy, so no `undo` removes it: the removal can stop partway, and one error
with no account of how far it got cannot tell a whole source from a remnant or from one already gone. An `undo` reverses a
rename through the same call, so a reversal that half succeeds answers this same `where`.

Unlike the three above, this answers on the loop's own thread: the ordinary case is one `renameat2`,
which costs less than spawning a thread. The compatibility paths above are not one syscall and
run on that same thread, so a directory rename on rclone or MEGA copies the whole tree inline before it
answers. See `AGENTS.md`, "Write operations and the undo journal".

### duplicate

`{"c":"duplicate","path":"<string>"}`

Example: `{"c":"duplicate","path":"/home/gm/photo.jpg"}`

Copies one path to a free sibling name and answers one `duplicated` line. The name walks
`"<stem> copy<ext>"`, `"<stem> copy 2<ext>"` and so on until one is free; `Path`'s own stem and
extension split the last dot only, so `backup.tar.zst` becomes `backup.tar copy.zst` and a dotfile keeps
its whole name as the stem. A directory row duplicates its whole tree.

### mkdir

`{"c":"mkdir","path":"<string>","name":"<string>"}`

Example: `{"c":"mkdir","path":"/home/gm","name":"Invoices"}`
Example: `{"c":"mkdir","path":"/home/gm"}`

Makes one empty directory inside `path` and answers one `made` line. `path` is the absolute parent: a
relative or missing `path` is refused before any syscall, because a bare name would otherwise land in
the backend's own working directory, which no listing ever names. `name` is a bare name under the rule
`rename` applies to `to`: `.`, `..`, anything containing `/` or an interior NUL is refused with an
`error` line whose `where` is `mkdir`. A name of only spaces is a legal name and is created as sent,
as it would be by `rename`; trimming is the field's job.

**A missing or empty `name` asks for the first free default name**, `New Folder`, then `New Folder 2`
and up, the same way `duplicate` picks ` copy N` itself rather than leaving it to the client: a client
holds a window of the listing and not the directory, so it cannot know which names are taken, and a
name taken by anything, a file included, is stepped past. That is the form an inline
create-then-rename flow sends; the `made` line then carries the name that was chosen. A typed name is
never renumbered.

**The directory is created with `mkdir(2)` and never merged into one already there.** A name already
taken by anything, file, directory or symlink, answers `a folder or file with that name already
exists` and touches nothing, the same rule `archivework.rs` states for its own staging directories.
Every other failure carries the OS's own sentence as `msg`: a parent that vanished since the listing
answers `No such file or directory (os error 2)`, a parent the user cannot write `Permission denied
(os error 13)`, a read-only mount `Read-only file system (os error 30)`, a name past `NAME_MAX` `File
name too long (os error 36)`.

Like `rename`, this answers on the loop's own thread and never takes the one-operation slot.

### meta

`{"c":"meta","row":<uint>,"text":<bool>,"media":<bool>,"archive":<bool>}`

Example: `{"c":"meta","row":4,"text":false,"media":false,"archive":true}`

The per-row extras the preview column names and a listing row does not carry, for **one row that a
client actually asked for**, never a sweep. `row` indexes the current listing, and a `row` outside it
is dropped in silence, so a client that changed directory has to re-ask once the new `rows` arrive.
Answers one `meta` line on a thread, because a media row costs an `ffprobe` and the loop waits on it.

The three booleans are the client's own hints, taken from the classification it already made: `text`
asks for a line count, `media` for a duration and sample rate, `archive` for the index. Each costs
something, so none is inferred here. A file whose header parses as an image is never counted for
lines whatever `text` says, because the newlines in a bitmap are a number nothing should be shown.

### undo

`{"c":"undo"}`

Reverses the most recent completed operation and answers one `undone` line naming which kind it was.
An empty journal answers an `error` line with `where` of `undo`, and so does a reversal that fails
removing what an operation created or restoring from the trash. A reversal that renames back goes
through the same call a `rename` does, so its failure answers `rename` or `rename-kept` instead.

**The journal is an in-memory ring of the last 50 completed operations and is not persisted**, so it
does not survive a restart. Each kind reverses as follows: a rename or a move renames back (still
refusing to clobber, because something may occupy the old name by now), a copy or a duplicate removes
what that operation created, and a trash restores through `gio trash --restore` using the URI captured
when it was trashed. A transfer that replaced an item reverses both halves in that one step, newest
first: the incoming item is removed or moved back, and then the item it replaced is restored from the
trash to its name. A reversal that fails stops the rest and is spent, so when the incoming half cannot
go (a partial folder copy with a file inside newer than its root) or the trash cannot be read back (a
`gio` with no `trash://` to list), the replaced item stays in the trash, restorable from the trash
browser rather than by `undo`. A `mkdir` removes the folder it made only while it is still empty: a folder the
user has filled since is theirs, so that reversal answers an `error` line, leaves it and its contents in
place, and is spent like any failed reversal, so the next `undo` reaches the operation before it.

**Only what an operation actually created or moved is recorded**, never a path it merely read, so an
undo can never delete a file the operation did not put there. An operation that changed nothing records
nothing, and a cancelled batch records only the items that succeeded. An item that failed short of a
cancel, and had already created its destination, records that partial destination too: the failure
leaves it on disk, because removing it on a transient error would destroy data, and the journal is what
lets `undo` remove it. A destination that already existed is never recorded, because nothing was created
there. The steps of one operation reverse
newest first, and a step that fails stops the rest rather than leaving the operation half-reversed with
nothing recording which half.

### jump

`{"c":"jump","id":<uint>,"favourites":[<string>,...],"recent":[<string>,...]}`

Example: `{"c":"jump","id":3,"favourites":["/home/gm/Projects"],"recent":["/home/gm/Pictures/screenshots/shot.png"]}`

The path bar's folder jump, asked **once per open of the bar**, never per keystroke: the client filters
the answer itself as the line changes. `favourites` are Flea's own favourites in their rail order, and
`recent` is the desktop's `recently-used.xbel` newest first, which the client reads with Qt's XML reader
because the backend has none, and keeps until the file changes. The backend adds the third source,
zoxide's ranking, from one `zoxide query --list --all --score`, and answers one `jumped` line from a thread, because zoxide is a subprocess
and a stat can block on a network mount. `id` is the client's own number for this open and comes back
on the answer, so an answer to an earlier open is told apart from this one's.

**Nothing is written.** `--all` is what keeps zoxide from pruning its own database on a query Flea made:
without it zoxide deletes entries missing for 90 days and saves. zoxide is optional: absent, it is an
empty source and says nothing. A zoxide that runs past 2 s is killed and draws nothing, and its answer is
read up to 1 MiB and its first 1,000 rows. Only one zoxide runs at a time: an open while an earlier one is
still running draws the last ranking that answered in time rather than starting a second, and an
open with no ranking kept yet draws no zoxide. Each source is checked on a thread of its
own against one shared 1 s budget, so a stat wedged on a dead mount drops that source's rows from that one on
and never the other sources. A recent file is checked only once the folder holding it resolved, on that
same budget and under that same key rule, so a wedged recent file costs its own row and never the answer. A check still running past the budget of the open that started it is wedged, and
the next open skips what it names rather than wedge behind it: its whole mount when that mount is NFS, SMB,
9p, Ceph, AFS or FUSE (read lexically from `/proc/self/mountinfo`, never through the mount), its own path
anywhere else. A dead share therefore holds at most one thread per source for good, not more per open, and a
check merely slow inside its budget is run again rather than skipped.

### gitstatus

`{"c":"gitstatus","id":1,"path":"/home/gm/flea"}` asks whether `path` sits inside a Git work
tree. The answer is asynchronous (git is a subprocess) and rides the same late channel as `jump`.

`{"t":"gitstatus","id":1,"path":"/home/gm/flea","repo":true,"root":"/home/gm/flea","branch":"main","head":"a1b2c3d4e5f6"}`

`repo` is false when git is missing, the path is not a work tree, or the probe timed out; `root`,
`branch` and `head` are then empty. `id` echoes the request so a navigated-away pane can drop a
late answer. One probe per directory change, never per row.

### gitgraph

`{"c":"gitgraph","id":2,"path":"/home/gm/flea","limit":500}` asks for the lane graph of the
repository that contains `path`. `limit` caps `git log --max-count` (1..2000, default 500; `0` means
default). The answer is asynchronous.

`{"t":"gitgraph","id":2,"path":"...","root":"...","head":"...","branch":"main","error":"","commits":[...]}`

Each commit carries `hash`, `short`, `parents`, `refs`, `subject`, `date`, `lane`, `through`,
`edges` (`from`/`to` lane indices), `width` and `is_head`. Lane layout matches gitk / GitKraken
(newest-first). Contest/worktree run overlays from Switchboard are not on this wire.

### quit

`{"c":"quit"}`

Stops the read loop, then answers the thumbnail work already asked for: every queued and
running job is drained and reported before the process exits, because a worker inside a
child owns a temp file in the shared cache that only its own return publishes or removes.
Draining is bounded; see `thumbed` below. Apart from those `thumbed` lines, no response.

**A queued `dirsize` row is not drained.** It answers nothing that outlives this process, unlike
a thumbnail's shared on-disk cache, so a row still waiting when `quit` arrives is simply dropped;
the client that asked for it is going away too. A `collisions` question still being asked is dropped the
same way, which is why a scripted client waits for its line before sending `quit`.

## Responses

### listed

`{"t":"listed","n":<uint>,"read":<float>,"sort":<float>,"v":<uint>,"path":<string>}`

Example: `{"t":"listed","n":100000,"read":26.400,"sort":2.500,"v":56,"path":"/home/gm"}`

`n` is the row count. `read` and `sort` are milliseconds, formatted to three decimal
places (`{:.3}`). Sent after a successful `list` and after a successful `sort`. `read` is
the scan plus any requested metadata pass after `list`, the metadata pass after a
`sort` by `size` or `mtime` (including its `date` alias), and `0.0` after a `sort` by
`name` or `kind`, which needs no metadata pass.

`v` is the listing directory's own filesystem id, sent once here rather than on every row because
every file in the directory shares it. A client compares it against the `v` of the directory row
being dropped on: equal is one volume and the drag moves, different is two and it copies. `v` is 0
when the directory could not be stat'd, and a client reads 0 as unknown and copies, because copying
where a move was meant is an annoyance and moving where a copy was meant loses the original.

`path` is the directory exactly as the `list` that made this listing spelled it, byte for byte, with a
trailing slash, a symlink or a `..` left unresolved, because a client drops any `listed` line whose
`path` differs from the one it asked for (`ui/js/Swap.js` `onListed`).

### rows

`{"t":"rows","start":<uint>,"rows":[{"n":<string>,"d":<bool>,"s":<uint>,"m":<int>,"p":<uint>,"i":<string>,"t":<bool>,"k":<uint>[,"l":<string>][,"v":<uint>]},...],"kinds":[<string>,...],"ms":<float>,"listing":<uint>}`

Example:
`{"t":"rows","start":0,"rows":[{"n":"say \"hi\".txt","d":false,"s":12,"m":1787790423,"p":33188,"i":"text-x-generic","t":false,"k":0},{"n":"photos","d":true,"s":4096,"m":1787790424,"p":16877,"i":"folder","t":false,"k":1,"v":56}],"kinds":["Plain text document","Folder"],"ms":1.250,"listing":1}`

`start` echoes the requested start, clamped to the listing's length: a `window`
whose `start` lands past the end of the listing answers with `start` equal to the
listing's length and an empty `rows` array, not the value that was requested.

Each row object holds a name (`n`, JSON-escaped; a valid UTF-8 name may carry any
character including a quote or a newline, but a non-UTF8 name arrives lossy and then
cannot be stat'd, so it reports zeroes, see AGENTS.md "Deliberate corners"), a
directory flag (`d`, the link's own type rather than its target's: a symlink to a
directory reports `d:false` and carries `S_IFLNK` in `p`), a size in bytes (`s`), an
mtime as a unix timestamp (`m`), a raw `st_mode` (`p`), a freedesktop icon name
(`i`), a thumbnailable flag (`t`), and a Kind index (`k`, into the envelope's own
`kinds` array).

**`l` is where a symlink points, and only a symlink row carries it.** It is the link's own bytes,
verbatim and unresolved, so a relative target stays relative and a broken link still names where it
points; a `readlink` that fails leaves the field off entirely, the same as any other row. The row it
sits on is the one that already pays a second stat for its icon, so the extra call lands on the rows
that were already the exception and on no others, and the scale fixture holds no links at all. A row
never carries both `l` and `v`: `d` is the link's own type, so a symlink's `d` is `false` and it is
never the directory row `v` is for. The client draws the target beside the name and the word `link`
in the size column, because a link's own `st_size` is the length of that target path and not a size
anyone means.

**`v` is the row's filesystem id, and only a directory row carries it.** A drop destination is
always a directory, so a file row's device would never be read, and the scale fixture is 100,000
files with no directories at all: sending it per row would be paid 100,000 times on the one path
that produces the headline listing number, for a field nothing reads. A client compares the `v` of
the rows being dragged against the `v` of the directory being dropped on: equal means one volume and
the drag moves, different means two and it copies, which is what Finder does. A directory whose stat
failed reports `p` 0 and `v` 0 with it. `ms` is the phase-2 stat time for this window, formatted to three
decimal places. Sent after `list` and after `window`. The last field is `listing`, the numbering these
rows are in; see "listing".

A row whose stat failed sends `s`, `m` and `p` all 0, and `p` is what says so: 0 is outside
`st_mode`'s domain, because a real one always carries its file-type bits. So `p` 0 needs no flag
beside it the way `lines` 0 needs `lfailed`, and it condemns that row's `s` and `m` with it: those
two are only readable when `p` is non-zero.

**`kinds` is a dictionary, not a string per row, because an earlier plan measured the
per-row-string shape and it cost milliseconds.** A directory has few distinct Kind
strings even at 100,000 files (a handful of file types, plus `"Folder"`), so every row
paying one integer instead of a repeated string keeps the response small without a
second round trip. A directory's Kind is always the literal `"Folder"`; a file's Kind
is `src/backend/kind.rs`'s freedesktop `<comment>` for its resolved MIME type,
canonicalised through `/usr/share/mime/aliases` the same way the thumbnailer spec
lookup already is, falling back to the literal `"Data"` both for a type with no comment
at all (`application/x-ms-dos-executable` is the one shipped example) and for a name no
glob matched. **An icon name is an internal string and this column is a human
description, so one never leaks into the other**, and a name nothing identified must not
claim to be text however far the icon ladder itself falls. Like the icon and
MIME tables, the comment cache is read once per distinct type for the life of the
backend process, never per row: the client is given a human description and never the
MIME type, because a display should not classify.

**The parser rule is the first `<comment>` carrying no `xml:lang` attribute, not the first
`<comment>` of any kind, and this was measured rather than assumed.** 8 of the first 200
`/usr/share/mime/*.xml` files on this box open with a translated comment before their
untranslated one; `application/msword.xml` is one of them, opening `xml:lang="zh-Hant-TW"`
with its untranslated comment further down the file, after every alias and glob line. A type
whose file carries no untranslated comment at all, or no comment element of any language,
answers `None`, which is why `Kinds::comment` returns `Option<String>` rather than an empty
string.

**No wording in that file is a property of the format, and nothing may assert one.** Every
`/usr/share/mime/<type>.xml` is generated by `update-mime-database` from the files in
`/usr/share/mime/packages/`, and no package owns the generated file, so the untranslated
string is whatever the applications installed on the box supply. `application/msword` reads
`Word document` from `shared-mime-info`'s own `freedesktop.org.xml` and `Microsoft Word
Document` from `libreoffice-fresh`'s `libreoffice.xml`, which outranks it; a box with
LibreOffice and a box without therefore disagree on the same distribution and the same
`shared-mime-info` version. Issue 1 was a test asserting the second string. The parser is
tested against a fixture and the live database is asserted only for shape: reachable, ASCII,
and free of markup.

Note that `t` inside a row object is a boolean, while the `t` at the top of every
response line is the message type, a string. They never collide: one is a member of a
row, the other a member of the envelope.

`i` is never empty. The backend resolves the row's name to a MIME type against
`/usr/share/mime/globs2`, then that type to an icon name against
`/usr/share/mime/generic-icons`, falling back to the media class (`image-x-generic`
and friends) and finally to `text-x-generic`; a directory is always `folder`. Both
tables are read once per backend process, never per row. The client is given the icon
name and never the MIME type, because a display should not classify.

Two rules sit above that resolution and neither follows from the name alone. **The icon of a
symlink follows the link's target while `d` still describes the link**: a symlink to a
directory reports `d:false`, because `d` is what the client navigates on, and `i` is `folder`,
because that is what the row looks like. Only symlink rows pay for it, through one extra stat
inside the window the client asked for. **An `application/*` type with no `generic-icons` entry
resolves by the row's own execute bit**, not by its class: 190 of the 613 such types in
`globs2` have no entry on this box, so the execute bits in `p` decide between
`application-x-executable` and `application-x-generic`. Both counts move with the installed
applications, the same merge described above: a root built from `freedesktop.org.xml` alone
gives 138 of 552. Without that rule every one of the 190 drew as a program, which is
how a `.pem` came to look executable.

`t` is true only when a validated thumbnailer declares the row's MIME type or an alias
of it. The backend resolves the row's name to a MIME type the same way it resolves the
icon, then looks that type up in the thumbnailer specs read from the freedesktop search
path, whose declarations and queries are both canonicalised through
`/usr/share/mime/aliases`, so either side of an alias pair matches. A spec whose
program is not a runnable executable is dropped when the table is built, so `t` is
false for a declared type with no working thumbnailer. `t` also reads the file type out of the
row's own `p`: a directory, a fifo, a socket and a device node are always false however they are
named, and a row that vanished between the listing and the stat reports `p` of 0 and is false
too. A symlink is true when its name resolves to a declared type, because the thumbnail request
stats the target; a symlink to a special file is then refused when the row is actually asked
for. Like
the icon tables, the alias and spec tables are read once per backend process, never per
row; the whole per-row cost of `t` is one hash lookup, tens of nanoseconds per row, so
it is invisible at a viewport of a few hundred rows. The client is still never given the
MIME type itself: `t` exists so a display does not have to reason about content types to
know whether asking for a thumbnail is worthwhile.

### searching

`{"t":"searching","n":<uint>,"scanned":<uint>,"ms":<float>}`

Example: `{"t":"searching","n":812,"scanned":41200,"ms":300.114}`

The streaming progress of a `search`, at most one every 100 ms while the walk runs. `n` is
the match count so far and is what the client sets its row total to; `scanned` is directory
entries looked at, which is the number the status bar counts up. It is deliberately not a
`listed` line: a mid-walk update is not a fresh listing and carries no `read` or `sort`
timing to report.

Matches are only ever appended, so a `window` the client already holds stays valid across
every one of these.

### searched

`{"t":"searched","n":<uint>,"scanned":<uint>,"ms":<float>,"cancelled":<bool>}`

Example: `{"t":"searched","n":6252,"scanned":45807,"ms":48.711,"cancelled":true}`

The terminal line of a `search`. `n` is the final match count and is authoritative: no
`listed` follows it. `scanned` is how many directory entries the walk looked at, which is
what the status bar counts up while it runs. `ms` is the whole walk, to three decimal
places. `cancelled` is true when a `searchcancel`, a `list` or a `sort` ended the walk early,
and false when it ran the subtree out. The rows are in rank order by the time this line is
written, so a client holding a window from before it has stale indices and re-reads.

### thumbed

`{"t":"thumbed","row":<uint>,"file":"<string>","ms":<float>}`

Example: `{"t":"thumbed","row":2,"file":"/home/gm/.cache/thumbnails/large/b98fa4082faa4a9cbb9728c94831a4b5.png","ms":75.823}`

Answers one row of one `thumb` request. `row` is the index that was asked for. `file` is
the absolute path of the PNG in the shared thumbnail cache, JSON-escaped like every other
string on this wire, and `ms` is milliseconds to three decimal places: the whole job for a
generated row, or just the lookup for a row answered from the cache, which is tens of
microseconds here against tens of milliseconds and up for a decode.

**`file` is empty rather than absent on failure**, so a client never waits forever for a
row that will not arrive. Every reason a row cannot be thumbnailed reads the same on the
wire: a directory, a file that is not a regular file, no thumbnailer for the type, a recorded
failure, a thumbnailer that failed, hung, or exited successfully having written nothing, or a
shutdown that cut the job short. A client that asked for a row
therefore gets exactly one `thumbed` line for it, unless it cancelled the row itself or
replaced the listing under it.

**A result for a superseded listing is dropped, never reported against the current one.**
The backend maps only the rows a client actually asked for back to their paths, and a
`list` or a `sort` clears that map and cancels the queue, because both change which row an
index names. A job already inside a worker still runs to its own end, and its result is
discarded on arrival rather than printed against a row it no longer describes.

Shutdown is bounded at 25 seconds in total, which is longer than the pool's own 20-second
job deadline, so no single running job can be cut short by it. If the budget does run out,
every row still unanswered is answered with an empty `file` before the process exits.

### dirsized

`{"t":"dirsized","row":<uint>,"bytes":<uint>,"partial":<bool>,"ms":<float>}`

Example: `{"t":"dirsized","row":4,"bytes":1048576,"partial":false,"ms":12.500}`

Answers one row of one `dirsize` request. `row` is the index that was asked for, `bytes` is the
recursive apparent size (every entry's own `st_size`, symlinks not followed and counted at their
own small size rather than their target's), and `ms` is the walk's own wall-clock time. The
target's own directory entry counts too, matching what `du -s` reports for the directory itself.

**`partial` is true when the 2000&nbsp;ms deadline cut the walk short, or a subtree inside it
answered permission denied.** Either way `bytes` is a floor, honestly labelled, never a wrong
exact number: everything the walk actually saw before it had to stop is still counted. The
shipped client renders a partial answer with a leading `>`.

**A result for a superseded listing is dropped, never reported against the current one.** A
`list` or a `sort` clears the answered-row cache and cancels the queue, the same rule and the
same reason `thumbed` follows: both change which row an index names.

### transferstarted

`{"t":"transferstarted","id":<uint>,"n":<uint>,"moving":<bool>}`

Example: `{"t":"transferstarted","id":12,"n":2,"moving":true}`

`id` names this operation for the life of the process and is what `transfercancel` takes. `n` is the
count of top-level paths, **never a recursive file count**: computing that before answering would be a
metadata sweep over an unbounded subtree, which is the shape this codebase refuses everywhere else, and
a transfer's first line is on the critical path of every operation.

`moving` is the verb the request actually resolved to, after the rule that anything which is not
exactly `"move"` copies. It is on the wire because the client cannot derive it: a paste spends a cut
clipboard before this line arrives, and a move to Dropbox never touches the clipboard at all, so a
client reading its own clipboard reports a move as a copy.

### extractstarted

`{"t":"extractstarted","id":<uint>}`

An archive `extract` sends this line before its one zero-byte `transferprogress` line. A current client
routes it into the existing transfer card as `n` 1, `moving` false and `extract` true, so the card says
Extracting without inventing bytes, a rate or an ETA. Older clients ignore this new type, while the
existing `archivedone` terminal line remains unchanged for archive clients.

### meta

`{"t":"meta","row":<uint>,"w":<uint>,"h":<uint>,"orient":<uint>,"ms":<uint>,"rate":<uint>,"entries":<uint>,"unpacked":<uint>,"afailed":<bool>,"names":[{"n":"<string>","d":<bool>},...],"lines":<uint>,"partial":<bool>,"lfailed":<bool>,"target":"<string>","targetdir":<bool>,"owner":"<string>"}`

Example: `{"t":"meta","row":4,"w":0,"h":0,"orient":1,"ms":0,"rate":0,"entries":214,"unpacked":3400,"afailed":false,"names":[{"n":"ui","d":true}],"lines":0,"partial":false,"lfailed":false,"target":"","targetdir":false,"owner":"gm"}`

Every field a row did not ask for is zero, false or empty. `w` and `h` are pixels, read from the
file's own header, as stored and before any turn. `ms` and `rate` come from the probe. `lines` is a
newline count with `partial` true when it stopped at its 1 MiB budget, so the column states it as a floor.

`orient` is the EXIF orientation, 1 to 8, from the same read of the same open. The walk that finds a
JPEG's frame header reads the head of its first `Exif` APP1 on the way past. It is 1 for every file that
names none, every non-JPEG included. Orientations 5 to 8 swap the sides, and the Columns frame and Quick
Look ask Qt for their decode size turned the same way, because Qt fits its decode before it turns.

`entries` and `unpacked` are **exact totals whenever they are non-zero**, because the index is
streamed and counting all of it costs no memory. `names` is capped at the first `ARCHIVE_NAME_CAP`
entries, which is the only part that is bounded: the tile lists those and states the difference as
its own "+ N more" line.

`lfailed` is true when the row produced no count at all, which on this box
means permission denied, a row that is not a regular file, or a row that vanished between the
listing and the request. **Nothing but a regular file is ever read here or for `w` and `h`**: a
`stat` refuses every other kind before any open, so a FIFO that `stat` sees is never opened at all
and its waiting writer is left where it was, and the open behind that stat is `O_NONBLOCK` with a
second `fstat` on the descriptor, so a row swapped for a FIFO inside that window is closed again
instead of leaving the row waiting forever. That one open does wake a writer parked in `open(2)`, and
closing it unread hands that writer an `EPIPE` on its next write if nothing else is reading: it is
the cost of refusing a swap the `stat` cannot see, not a case the `stat` avoids. A FIFO, a socket, a
device or a directory answers its `stat` facts with no dimensions and no count. It is what tells
`lines` 0 apart from an empty file, whose `lines` is also 0: zero is a real count, so
unlike `mode` on an `error` line it cannot carry the failure itself. A row that never asked for a
count sends `lines` 0 and `lfailed` false, the same as a row whose count really is zero, because
nothing was attempted; the client knows which kind it asked about.

`afailed` is true when the listing was not completed, which covers a tool that could not read the
archive and a read that outran its wall-clock budget. **A failed read sends `entries` 0, `unpacked` 0
and an empty `names`**, so a partial count never reaches a client that has been told the number is a
total. That is a different answer from an archive holding nothing, which sends the same zeroes with
`afailed` false, and the two are drawn as the error state and the empty state respectively.

`target` is a symlink's own target and `targetdir` says whether that target is a directory, so the
column's mark can follow the target the way a listing row's does.

`owner` is the login name of the user who owns the path itself (a symlink reports the link's owner, as
its row does), resolved from `/etc/passwd` alone and never through `getpwuid`: that call goes through
NSS and can wait on a network directory, and the meta thread must never hang the column on one. A uid
no local account carries answers the empty string, never the number dressed as a name.

### collisions

`{"t":"collisions","id":<uint>,"total":<uint>,"names":[{"n":"<string>","d":<bool>,"i":"<string>"},...]}`

Example: `{"t":"collisions","id":7,"total":2,"names":[{"n":"screenshot.png","d":false,"i":"image-x-generic"},{"n":"notes","d":true,"i":"folder"}]}`

`total` counts every colliding source. `names` is the first three of them in request order, which is
all a client's card lists before its "and N more" line, so the answer stays small however wide the
selection. `n` is the incoming item's name, `d` whether it is a directory and `i` the same icon name a
`rows` row carries, for the card's kind mark. A `total` of 0 means nothing collides; the shipped client
then sends its transfer with `collide` `refuse`, so a name that appears in the meantime is still refused.

### transferprogress

`{"t":"transferprogress","id":<uint>,"index":<uint>,"name":"<string>","bytes":<uint>,"total":<uint>[,"phase":"writing"]}`

Example: `{"t":"transferprogress","id":12,"index":0,"name":"a.txt","bytes":40000000,"total":120000000}`

Throttled to at most one line per 150 ms per item, so a fast copy of a small file may emit none at all
before its terminal line; that is correct and not a missing message.

**Only a regular file reports bytes.** A directory has no total without the sweep this codebase does not
do, and a same-filesystem move is a single `rename(2)` with nothing to report partway through, so
neither emits these lines at all. A client renders an item with no progress as indeterminate.
On a durable target (usb, phone, network, or vfat/exfat/ntfs) those bytes are reported only after
the drive confirms them, so the rate is the drive's real rate.

**The final phase rides one more of these lines.** After the last file, the transfer emits
`{"t":"transferprogress","id":<uint>,"index":0,"name":"","bytes":0,"total":0,"scanned":0,"phase":"writing","drive":"<string>"}`
while it fsyncs every directory it created or wrote into. Cancel is not honoured there because
every file is already complete. `drive` is the destination's own name, so the card's headline
names where the flush is going without guessing from timing. Older clients ignore the fields
they never asked for.

**An extract's one progress line is not a transfer's.** It carries the archive's own file name as
`name` with `bytes` and `total` both 0: the unpacking tool streams no per-item bytes, so any figure for
it would be invented and no percentage or time left is offered for it.

### transferitem

`{"t":"transferitem","id":<uint>,"index":<uint>,"name":"<string>","ok":<bool>,"err":"<string>"}`

Example: `{"t":"transferitem","id":12,"index":0,"name":"a.txt","ok":true}`
Example: `{"t":"transferitem","id":12,"index":1,"name":"photos","ok":false,"err":"permission denied"}`

Exactly one per top-level item the transfer starts, in the order the items were named; an item it
never starts, one a cancel reached first, one a `skip` left or a move already in place, answers none. **`err` rides only on a failure**, so
a successful item's line carries no empty field to reason about, and a permission error on one file is
that item's data rather than the operation's: the batch carries on to the next item. What a failed item
had already written stays where it is and is journaled as that operation's own creation, so an `undo`
removes it; only a cancel removes its partial itself, see `transfercancel`.

### transferdone

`{"t":"transferdone","id":<uint>,"ok":<uint>,"failed":<uint>,"skipped":<uint>,"cancelled":<bool>,"durable":<bool>,"note":"<string>"}`

Example: `{"t":"transferdone","id":12,"ok":1,"failed":1,"skipped":0,"cancelled":false,"durable":false,"note":""}`

The whole operation's terminal line. `skipped` counts the items the transfer did not start by design:
those a cancel reached before they started, the colliding items a `collide` of `skip` left in place,
and an item a `collide` move would have put back where it already is. A cancelled `replace` whose
put-back failed is counted in `failed` instead, see `transfer`. `cancelled` is true when a
`transfercancel`, a `quit` or stdin closing ended it early. `durable` is true only when the
destination needed durability and every flush succeeded, so the UI can say "written to the drive";
local targets report false and never claim it, and so do rclone ones, which skip the flush by design.
`note` carries the sentence the UI prints beside the done count: `copied, but the drive did not
confirm the folder` when the files landed but a folder flush did not, and `rclone uploads them in
the background` for a copy onto an rclone mount, and is empty otherwise.

### trashed

`{"t":"trashed","ok":<uint>,"failed":<uint>}`

Example: `{"t":"trashed","ok":1,"failed":0}`

Counts only. Unlike `transferitem` there is no per-path error text, because trash is one `gio` call for
the batch and its exit status cannot attribute a failure to a single path; a path that is still on disk
afterwards is counted in `failed`.

### renamed

`{"t":"renamed","ok":<bool>,"path":"<string>"}`

Example: `{"t":"renamed","ok":true,"path":"/home/gm/new.txt"}`

`path` is the full path the file now has. A refusal is an `error` line instead, never this line with
`ok` false.

### duplicated

`{"t":"duplicated","ok":<bool>,"path":"<string>"}`

Example: `{"t":"duplicated","ok":true,"path":"/home/gm/photo copy.jpg"}`

`path` is the sibling that was written. A failure is an `error` line with `where` of `duplicate`, and a
copy that failed partway leaves its partial sibling in place and journals it, so an `undo` removes it.

### made

`{"t":"made","ok":<bool>,"path":"<string>"}`

Example: `{"t":"made","ok":true,"path":"/home/gm/New Folder"}`

`path` is the full path of the directory that now exists, the chosen default included when the request
sent no `name`, which is what lets a client re-list with that row under the cursor and open its rename
field on it. A refusal is an `error` line with `where` of `mkdir` instead, never this line with `ok`
false.

### undone

`{"t":"undone","op":"<string>","ok":<bool>}`

Example: `{"t":"undone","op":"move","ok":true}`

`op` is the kind of operation that was reversed, one of `rename`, `duplicate`, `mkdir`, `trash`, `copy`
or `move`, which is what lets the status bar say what it just put back.

### jumped

`{"t":"jumped","id":<uint>,"favourites":[<string>,...],"zoxide":[<string>,...],"recent":[<string>,...],"frecency":{<string>:<float>,...},"ms":<float>}`

Example: `{"t":"jumped","id":3,"favourites":["/home/gm/Projects"],"zoxide":["/home/gm/Documents"],"recent":["/home/gm/Pictures/screenshots"],"frecency":{"/home/gm/Documents":80},"ms":4.210}`

The answer to one `jump`: the folders of each source that exist now, each source in its own order.
A favourite or a zoxide row must itself be a directory; a recent entry stands for the folder it sits in,
unless it is a folder itself. A folder appears once, in the first source that names it, so a favourite
zoxide also ranks is drawn as the favourite. `frecency` is zoxide's score for every folder answered that
zoxide ranks, whichever source draws it, and the client ranks the one list by it after the match itself.
Anything that is not an absolute path is dropped, and so is a score that is not a finite number. `ms` is
the whole answer's time, zoxide and the existence checks together.

### changed

`{"t":"changed","path":"<string>"}`

Example: `{"t":"changed","path":"/home/gm/Downloads"}`

**The one line no request asks for.** Every other response answers a request; this one says the
directory the current listing came from is no longer what `list` answered with, because another
program created, deleted, renamed, wrote or chmod'd something in it. Nothing the backend holds
changes with it: the rows, the count and the sort order are exactly what they were, and a client
that wants the new directory sends `list` again. `path` is the watched directory, so a client that
has navigated since the notification was written can tell it is not about the folder it is on now,
and drop it.

A `list` starts watching its path **before it reads the directory**, not after, because a change
landing while the read runs is missing from the rows that `list` is about to answer with and is
therefore exactly the change the client has to be told about. It is armed **beside** the watch the
client is already on rather than in place of it, so a `list` that then fails to scan costs the
directory still listed nothing at all: its watch was never removed, and the descriptor its own
events carry is still the current one. `search` and `listpaths` both stop watching, because a set of
matches and a set of named paths are not directories.

The mechanism is one inotify watch on that one directory, non-recursive, with the mask
`IN_ATTRIB | IN_CLOSE_WRITE | IN_MOVED_FROM | IN_MOVED_TO | IN_CREATE | IN_DELETE | IN_MOVE_SELF`,
which is exactly the set of events that changes what a listing says: which names are in it, and the
size, date and mode its columns draw. Deleting the watched directory needs no bit of its own: the
kernel removes the watch along with it and reports that removal whatever the mask holds.
**A file growing under an open handle is not one of them.** `IN_MODIFY` fires on every `write(2)`
and a listing does not draw a partial size, so a row's size follows the writer closing the file
rather than the writer writing to it.

**One burst is one line.** The event payload is read only far enough to name its watch descriptor,
never for which file moved, and the reader then pauses 100 ms before reading again, so a directory
being rewritten costs one `changed` line per 100 ms rather than one per file. Anything the kernel
drops in that window costs nothing, because every event in a burst says the same thing to a client
that re-reads the whole directory anyway.

`--backend` on a box whose inotify instance limit is exhausted prints one sentence to stderr at
startup and then never sends this line, and a `list` whose directory the kernel refuses a watch on
(`max_user_watches`, most often) prints one naming that directory; every other request answers
exactly as before. A client must therefore treat a live listing as an improvement it may not get,
not as a guarantee. A
network mount is the other case: inotify sees the local kernel's own view of a directory, so a
change another machine makes to an NFS or SMB share is not delivered, and Flea is stale there in
exactly the way it was before this line existed.

### error

`{"t":"error","where":"<string>","path":"<string>","msg":"<string>"[,"mode":<uint>]}`

Example: `{"t":"error","where":"scan","path":"/root","msg":"permission denied","mode":16872}`

`where` names the failing operation, `path` names the input that failed, `msg` is the
underlying message. Over `--backend`'s stdout, `where` is `scan` (a `list` whose path
failed to read), `sort` (a `sort` whose key names no order this wire defines; `path`
carries the key as sent), `stale` (a row-indexed request naming a numbering the listing has
left; `path` carries the command, see "listing"), or `read` (the
stdin stream itself could not be decoded; the loop stops right after emitting this
line, because the framing cannot be trusted past that point; thumbnail work already
running is still drained after it, so a `thumbed` line can follow). The write
operations answer over the same stdout and name themselves the same way, and
`rename-kept` (see `rename`) is the only value on this wire that is not one lowercase
word, so a client matching this field must allow the hyphen. `error_line`
is also how `flea --prewarm` reports a failure, to stderr rather than over this wire
protocol. `where` names whichever operation actually failed: a missing or unreadable
`path` propagates `scan`'s error unchanged, so `where` reads `scan` there too; only a
failure inside prewarm's own file handling (creating, writing or renaming the temp
file) reports `where":"prewarm"`. An `error` line is sent instead of `listed` or
`rows`; it never changes the backend process's exit code.

`mode` is the `st_mode` of the path a `scan` could not read, in decimal, and it is written only when
the backend actually read it. It is a directory's mode in the case the field exists for; a `list` of
a regular file fails with `ENOTDIR` and carries that file's mode instead, which no client draws,
because only a denial reaches the Locked state. The stat outlives the denial: `/root` answers 16872, which is
`0o40750`, while `opendir` on it is refused. No other `where` ever carries the field, and a `scan`
whose path could not be stat'd either leaves it out, which a client reads as "I could not look" and
draws as a sentence with no permission string under it. It exists because a typed path, or
`FLEA_PATH`, reaches the denial with no parent listing to remember the mode from.

## Prewarm reuses this wire format

`flea --prewarm <path> <first> <dest>` writes exactly a `listed` line then a `rows`
line, the same two lines `--backend` would print for an equivalent `list`, to `dest`
instead of stdout. See `AGENTS.md`, "Prewarm".

`--prewarm` exits 0 if and only if `dest` holds a complete listing of `path`; on
failure it writes an error line to stderr, exits non-zero, leaves no temp file, and
does not touch `dest`, so a caller must check the exit status before reading the
file.

## Undocumented requests

`peek`, `paths`, `archive`, `convert` and `formats` are on the wire and are not documented
here yet. `tools/flea-acceptance` derives its checklist from this file, so each one is a gap in that
battery until its section is written.

The `formats` and `archive` parts of that set are named here exactly, because they changed. A `formats` reply's `extract`
object carries one bit per extension class: `{"archive":<bool>,"sevenZip":<bool>,"zip":<bool>}`, where
`archive` is the tar class on `bsdtar`, `sevenZip` is the `.7z` class on `7z`, and `zip` is the
`.zip`/`.rar` class served by whichever of those two is installed. An `archive` request with an `op` of
`extract` takes the one-at-a-time slot `transfer` describes, drives that same transfer card and answers
`archivedone`, never `transferdone`; a `transfercancel` naming its `id` cancels it, and it is not
journaled, so no `undo` reverses it.

One `peek` field is worth naming ahead of that section, because it is new. A `peeked` line whose scan
failed carries `"failed":true`, with `"mode":<uint>` beside it under the same rule the `error` line
uses, so a column can tell an unreadable directory from an empty one instead of drawing both as the
empty state. A `peeked` line that succeeded carries neither field, whatever `n` is.

Two more `peek` fields are worth naming for the same reason. Every `peeked` line, failed or not,
echoes the `hidden` its request carried, because two clients read this wire at once: `ui/ColumnsArea.qml`
peeks the pane's ancestors with the listing's own flag, and the path bar's Tab peeks with whatever
the typed leaf asks for. `path` alone cannot tell one client's reply from the other's, and `path`
plus `hidden` can, which is all the correlation either needs: the same pair answers the same rows,
so no request id has to be threaded through. A client that ignores the field reads the line exactly
as it did before.

## Known gaps

- The two-line prewarm file names its directory, as every `listed` line does, but nothing
  in it says whether that directory changed after it was written, so a stale file cannot be
  told from a fresh one and production ignores `FLEA_PREWARM`. Add a freshness proof and
  prove a first-paint win before re-enabling a reader.
- The pool is built when the backend starts, not when the first `thumb` arrives. That
  costs every backend process about 1.2 ms of startup and about 0.5 MB of PSS for a
  subsystem a client may never use; see AGENTS.md "Thumbnail requests".
- `thumbcancel` names rows, and only rows this process actually queued can be cancelled.
  Cancelling a row that was answered from the cache, or that no thumbnailer declares, is
  silently a no-op, because there was never a job to drop.
- `t` is true for a symlink whose name resolves to a declared type, whatever the link points at.
  The flag reads the file type out of the row's own `p`, which for a symlink is `S_IFLNK` and says
  nothing about the target, so a symlink to a directory, to a FIFO, to a loop, or to nothing at
  all still reports `t:true`. Every one of them is answered with an empty `file` in microseconds
  when it is actually asked for, because the request path stats the target, so nothing blocks and
  no marker is written. It is an over-promise on the wire rather than a hazard, and a client that
  renders per-row state from `t` alone will show a thumbnail slot that never fills. The shipped
  GUI renders defensively instead of the wire narrowing: an empty `file` is a terminal answer in
  its row map and the delegate falls back to the themed icon, so such a row simply keeps the icon
  it already drew. Narrowing the flag stays undone on purpose, because it is a wire change with
  its own documentation and test surface and half-narrowing it is worse than leaving it whole.
- A non-UTF8 filename arrives lossy, and the thumbnail path inherits that. Two names in one
  directory differing only in their invalid bytes collapse to the same string, so the backend
  maps one path where the client named two rows and the second row's `thumbed` line arrives
  only at the next `list`, `sort` or shutdown. See AGENTS.md "Deliberate corners".
- The `file` a `thumbed` line names is read from the shared cache, which every application on
  the box writes, and nothing sandboxes the client that decodes it. Generation runs under
  `bwrap`; display does not. The shipped GUI does hand this path straight to a QML `Image`, so
  Qt's PNG decoder runs unconfined in the shell process on bytes it did not write. That is a
  known residual risk, parked for a later plan rather than closed here. See AGENTS.md
  "Deliberate corners".
